# Week 2 Testing JavaScript, HTML and CSS concepts.

Contained in this folder is an assignment project that was given after the second week in THEJitu.com.

The assignment needed me to be creative and apply the JS knowledge learnt. Along with it is the use
of CSS and HTML to manipulate the DOM. The following were the requirements of the site:

###### Use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No Library or Framework, No Database too

**This assignment is to build a Todo Application that is supposed to do the following:**
- Able to create a task with a title, description and date (expected completion date)
- Able to update (on update, Pre-populate the input fields) and delete a task
- Able to list all completed and uncompleted tasks (if not Completed/ Uncompleted show a message)
- Able to mark a task as completed and move it from uncompleted to completed
- Able to show tasks that were completed on time and by how many days, and the tasks that were submitted late

**Other Important Considerations**
User Interface - make it interactive
Validation of inputs
Creativity
